### Hello GitHub! ðŸ˜„ðŸ‘‹

My name is <b>Netanel Kozel</b>, I'm currently 25-year-old and live in Israel. I'm a third-year student pursuing a B.Sc in <b>Software Engineering.</b>

As a Full-Stack developer I have the opertunity to write secure cloud applications and programs that reaches thousands of people.
My expertise and favorite would be writing Node.js applications and microservices in the back-end side and React.js applications in the front-end. My stack includes various frameworks such as Expressjs, Nextjs and Remix.

For databases I mainly use non-relational databases such as AWS, MongoDB or Firebase Firestore, but I'm also familiar with PostgreSQL and ORM in JS and TS.

I'm also familiar with

* Java development, including the Spring framework for REST APIs
* Prompt engineering with maximum utilization of <b>artificial intelligence</b>

I'm constantly seeking new challenges to enhance my skills. Learning and problem-solving aren't just tasks for me; they're my passion. 

I always push myself to think big and find innovative solutions. Whether it's contributing to a project or seeking areas for improvement, I'm committed to making a difference. ðŸ’¡ 

I'm doing my best to donate to the open-source community as much as I can and am looking to collaborate at some interesting full-stack applications ðŸ‘¯
